💡 Cantilever Internship Projects

Welcome to my internship project repository for Cantilever. This repo contains two machine learning projects assigned during the internship program:

🧠 Sentiment Analysis System
💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
All projects are implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab. These tasks showcase basic data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

📘 Project 1: Sentiment Analysis System

Goal: Analyze movie reviews and classify them as positive or negative using natural language processing (NLP).

Technologies Used:

Python
NLTK
scikit-learn
Google Colab
Steps Performed:

Loaded movie review dataset from NLTK
Preprocessed and vectorized text data
Built a Naive Bayes classification model
Evaluated accuracy and classification report

📗 Project 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Goal: Detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using machine learning and handle data imbalance.

Technologies Used:

Python
pandas
scikit-learn
imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
Google Colab
Steps Performed:

Loaded dataset (creditcard.csv)
Applied SMOTE to handle imbalance
Built a Random Forest classifier
Evaluated performance using accuracy and precision/recall metrics
